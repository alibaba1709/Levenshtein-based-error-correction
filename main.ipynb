    "We will proceed using Levenshtein distance method.\n",

    "Here is a breakdown of the code:\n",
    "- len1 and len2 store the lengths of word1 and word2 respectively.\n",
    "- dp is a 2D list initialized with zeros, where dp[i][j] represents the Levenshtein distance between the first i characters of word1 and the first j    characters of word2.\n",
    "- The nested loop iterates over all possible pairs of indices (i, j) within the bounds of len1 and len2.\n",
    "- The base cases are handled first:\n",
    "  - If i (representing the length of word1) is 0, the distance is j (since we need to insert j characters into an empty string to make it word2).\n",
    "  - If j (representing the length of word2) is 0, the distance is i (similarly, we need to delete i characters from word1 to make it an empty string).\n",
    "- For other cases, if the characters at word1[i - 1] and word2[j - 1] are the same, no operation is needed, and the distance remains the same as for    the previous substrings (dp[i - 1][j - 1]).\n",
    "  If the characters are different, we consider three possible operations:\n",
    "   - Deletion: dp[i - 1][j] + 1\n",
    "   - Insertion: dp[i][j - 1] + 1\n",
    "   - Substitution: dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1\n",
    "  We take the minimum of these three values and store it in dp[i][j].\n",
    "- Finally, we return dp[len1][len2], which represents the Levenshtein distance between the entire word1 and word2.\n"
